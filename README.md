Hey!

This project is part of 'Frontend Mentor' challenge. Solution to my project could be found here: https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/space-tourism-multipage-website-XOcNwD2ZYd

I was inspired by YouTube CSS guru Kevin Powell that covered this challenge in one of his videos. I decided to improve this project by having it run as Vue application. Also, this was the first time I used mobile-first approach which was exciting!

As mentioned, application is powered by Vue3 framework. Also, I used Vue transition, router and dynamic component taking the data from the provided json file.

Let me know if something could be improved. Cheers!
