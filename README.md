Hey!

This project is part of 'Frontend Mentor' challenge. Solution to my project could be found here: https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/space-tourism-multipage-website-XOcNwD2ZYd

I was inspired by YouTube CSS guru Kevin Powell that covered this challenge in one of his videos. I decided to improve this project by having it run as Vue application. Also, this was the first time I used mobile-first approach which was exciting!

List of technologies used: Vue3, Vue Transition, Vanilla JS, Mobile-first, SCSS, RWD optimized, Grid

Let me know if something could be improved. Cheers!
